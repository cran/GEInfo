Description: Realize three approaches for Gene-Environment interaction analysis. All of them adopt Sparse Group Minimax Concave Penalty to identify important G variables and G-E interactions, and simultaneously respect the hierarchy between main G and G-E interaction effects. All the three approaches are available for Linear, Logistic, and Poisson regression. Also realize to mine and construct prior information for G variables and G-E interactions.
